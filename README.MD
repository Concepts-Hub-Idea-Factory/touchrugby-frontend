# Instructions

*Please read and follow the insturctions carefully.*

1. Do not modify the source code of this project, instead create a bew branch and code on the new branch.

2. After you have completed your work, push the changes to your branch not the main branch.

3. The files you need are:
    - ./touchrugby.html
    - ./about.html
    - ./rules.html
    - ./assets/styles/touchrugby.css
    - ./assets/styles/about.css
    - ./assets/styles/rules.css
    - ./assets/scripts/touchrugby.js
    - ./assets/scripts/about.js
    - ./assets/scripts/rules.js
    - ./assets/images/* (all files in the "./assets/images/ directory" )

4. Ideally, you do not the sass files, they are for frontend development.

5. Happy coding!

# TLDR; If you need to modify any frontend file, do so in a separate branch and not in the main branch, else the changes made from the local repository (frontend codebase) may overwrite your work progress.

> Alternatively, you can fork or create a new repository and make all your changes there.
